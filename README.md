ITM90B Django Website for bonus implementation

I lead the design and creation of an ecommerce website for my group's capstone project, using Django, a Python based web framework. Making the website was a bonus. None of us had any prior experience using Python for development (or any experience developing at all), so it was a major learning curve. 

Nevertheless, we were successful in creating a REST API, connecting a MySQL database (created by us) with actual relevant data to the website, creating a homepage, a catalogue page, an order creation page, order history page, a log-in page with an option to logout, and a navigation bar. Note that for all the pages listed, the website was communicating with our database - all data shown was from the database and all data created was sent to the database.

The website was far from perfect, it was never live and only locally accessed, and it wasn't totally made to match our initial design. But we were very proud of it because it demonstrated our sheer will in our pursuit of our learning to benefit both our academic and professional careers. We took a risk in attempting it since we were all new to programming for development, and we all had extremely demanding academic schedules in our final year of school, plus the rest of the capstone project to finish.
